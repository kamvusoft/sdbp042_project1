### WHAT ARE YOU BUILDING?

You are building a simple "Posts App"

The user can:
- See posts
- Add a post
- Edit a post
- Delete a post
- Search posts

------------------------------------------------------
VERY IMPORTANT (READ THIS CAREFULLY)
------------------------------------------------------
We are using a FAKE API.

That means:
- The server DOES NOT save your changes
- If you refresh, all changes are gone

So YOU must:
- Store data in your own state
- Update it manually
- Re-render the UI

RULE (MOST IMPORTANT):
After ANY action:
1. Update STATE
2. Re-render UI
------------------------------------------------------


### HOW THE APP IS BUILT

The app is split into 4 parts:

1. STATE  → stores data
2. API    → sends requests
3. UI     → displays data
4. APP    → connects everything

Think of it like:

STATE = data
API   = communication
UI    = display
APP   = control flow

------------------------------------------------------



## PART 1: STATE (CLOSURE)

This stores your data privately.

You must:
- Store posts in an array
- Add new post
- Update post
- Delete post
- Track if editing

IMPORTANT:
Only STATE controls the data.
UI must NOT store data.



## PART 2: API

This ONLY sends requests.

You must:
- GET posts
- POST new post
- PUT update post
- DELETE post

IMPORTANT:
API does NOT update your UI
API does NOT store real data

YOU must update STATE yourself.



## PART 3: UI

This ONLY controls what user sees.

You must:
- Show posts
- Create Edit button
- Create Delete button
- Fill form when editing

IMPORTANT:
UI should NOT store posts
It ONLY displays what STATE gives it


## PART 4: APP (MAIN LOGIC)

This connects everything.

You must:
- Load posts when app starts
- Call API
- Update STATE
- Re-render UI

This is where everything comes together



### EXACT STEPS YOU MUST FOLLOW

STEP 1: LOAD POSTS
- Call API to get posts
- Save them in STATE
- Render them

--------------------------------------

STEP 2: SHOW POSTS
- Loop through posts
- Show title and body
- Add Edit button
- Add Delete button

--------------------------------------

STEP 3: CREATE POST
- Call API (POST)
- Add post to STATE
- Re-render UI

--------------------------------------

STEP 4: EDIT POST
- Fill form with post data
- Set editing mode = true

--------------------------------------

STEP 5: UPDATE POST
- Call API (PUT)
- Update post in STATE
- Re-render UI

--------------------------------------

STEP 6: DELETE POST
- Call API (DELETE)
- Remove post from STATE
- Re-render UI

--------------------------------------

STEP 7: SEARCH
- Filter posts from STATE
- Re-render UI

--------------------------------------



### MOST COMMON MISTAKES (AVOID THESE)

- Expecting API to save data
- Not updating STATE after API call
- Not re-rendering UI
- Storing data inside UI

------------------------------------------------------



### FINAL RULE (REMEMBER THIS)

STATE controls everything

If UI is wrong → STATE is wrong

ALWAYS:
change STATE → then render UI
